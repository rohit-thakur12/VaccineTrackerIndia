## VaccineTrackerIndia

This is a very basic service that sends you a message on your phone when the vaccine is available at a centre near you.

You need to provide all the pincodes that you are looking for in config.json.

This code uses twilio to send sms but you can change it to email if that suits you. 

You can schedule this code to be run every hour or depending on your requirement using either cron, windows scheduler or anything that fits your needs.
